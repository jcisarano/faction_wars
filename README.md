## Fallen Earth Faction Wars (2010)
Faction Wars was a facebook game companion to the MMO Fallen Earth (2009). Players would join one of the factions from the MMO and complete missions to earn points for their faction. It was never released beyond in-house and friends-and-family testing.

Missions and in-game items were created by the design team and were related to elements in the MMO. All art came from the game. I was the sole programmer on the project.

A few things that might be interesting:

- docs directory - Design documents, spreadsheets, instructions, test notes, a few screenshots
- handlers directory - Essentially an API of actions hit by AJAX calls from the client
- channel directory - If I recall correctly, this was a fb requirement
-
